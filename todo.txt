CUSTOM NODES

should be able to set the names of inputs/outputs
dropping in a previously created, nested custom node causes placed node to return null value
insure unnecessary deps are removed on startup
enter custom node by double click

WORKSPACES MENU

workspaces menu - should be "refreshable"
workspace browser should divide between custom nodes and projects

node port heights are messed up when zoomed
formula node input should change width based on how much user inputs, allow multiple lines
formula node does not allow "quotes"
disable node lacing
icons for nodes
should remember the old 3d orientation

icons for undo/redo/copy/paste

optimize css:
	eliminate inline css
	get rid of excess bootstrap css, jquery.ui css


FEATURE

OBJ export
initial user walkthrough of interface - just modify help
example workspaces
fork a workspace
share workspaces
describe workspace
arbitrary javascript node - better than formula
NURBS in flood
run execution in ui thread, make calls to ui thread from worker


THOUGHTS

verb: 
	breps
	use distributed computation
	use a neural network to train system for local or remote exec
flood: 
	promise-based execution would allow multiple execution paths to proceed in parallel if nodes are dispatched async - this is a VERY good idea
