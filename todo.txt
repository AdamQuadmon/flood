CURRENT

login/signup doesn't give you any messages when it fails!

POLISH

logging in seems to kill your past session
set exact number
desktop zoom is too slow
editing formula, number values doesn't get updated with undo/redo
failure message on nodes
login/signup sucks should work with oauth - initially
removing all connections from formula leaves hanging connection
sticky text inputs on formula, workspace tabs
curves - whats the minimum requirement - line - polyline?
transforms?
hide slider on number
ability to turn off live execution!
disable node lacing
can't tell why node failed execution - show result
node context menus are too big
don't keep workspaces that haven't been saved at least once
should remember the old 3d 
save is too sporadic
workspace execution icon in weird location


FEATURE

canvas marquee selection
arbitrary javascript node - better than formula
zoom
STL
promise-based execution
