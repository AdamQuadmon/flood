login/signup sucks should work with oauth - initially
editing formula, number values doesn't get updated with undo/redo
removing all connections from formula leaves hanging connection
sticky text inputs on formula, workspace tabs
node ports with defaults should be black
curves - whats the minimum requirement - line - polyline?
transforms?
ability to turn off live execution
disable node lacing
can't tell why node failed execution
node context menus are too big
don't keep workspaces that haven't been saved at least once
should remember the old 3d 
save is too sporadic
