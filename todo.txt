CUSTOM NODES

hidden workspaces - this should be the default when loading a workspace dependency
setCurrentWorkspace should reveal the hidden workspace
closing a project should cleanup hidden workspaces - removing the ones that are not depended upon
should be able to set the names of inputs/outputs

POLISH

node port heights are messed up when zoomed
save zoom when changed
share workspaces
fork a workspace
OBJ export
example workspaces
initial user walkthrough of interface - just modify help
formula node input should change width based on how much user inputs, allow multiple lines
formula node does not allow "quotes"
disable node lacing
icons for nodes
should remember the old 3d orientation
workspaces menu should update when you reopen it
icons for undo/redo/copy/paste

optimize css:
	eliminate inline css
	get rid of excess bootstrap css, jquery.ui css

FEATURE

before release

easily add a new library of nodes
archive workspaces
describe workspace
arbitrary javascript node - better than formula
NURBS in flood

run execution in ui thread, make calls to ui thread from worker

promise-based execution

verb: 
	use a neural network to train system for local or remote exec
flood: 
	promise-based execution would allow multiple execution paths to proceed in parallel if nodes are dispatched async - this is a VERY good idea
