##flood

###What is it?

flood is a [dataflow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming)-style visual programming language based on Scheme that runs on JavaScript.  It is based on the [Dynamo](http://github.com/ikeough/Dynamo) visual programming language.  flood runs in a browser and as a standalone application on all platforms via [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).  


###Features

As an interactive visual programming environment, flood allows the user to search for nodes, drag and select nodes, make connections between nodes, and get feedback about data as it is transformed through the graph.  flood, like Dynamo, is based on Scheme and provides "visual syntactic sugar" for partial function application.  It uses a [lightweight scheme interpreter](http://github.com/pboyer/scheme.js) to evaluate the graph and caches values on a per node basis by storing dirty state.  Unlike Dynamo, flood currently does not have automapping functionality.

flood uses [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) to manage dependencies between JavaScript files and [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) to stick it all together.  This makes the application maintainable and scalable.  

flood is bundled with a library of nodes for [csg.js](http://evanw.github.io/csg.js/) and basic arithmetic.

[flood for Windows](http://floodlang.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/releases/flood/flood-windows.zip)


###Getting started

flood is scaffolded with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for task management and [Bower](http://bower.io/) for web package management.  If you're not familiar with these tools, you should take a look at the docs and get them installed.  


####Installing dependencies

To install all of the dependencies for flood, do:

	bower install
	npm install

This will install all of the development dependencies for Grunt and all of the public dependencies with bower.

####Running a server

This will start a HTTP server serving up the app directory and start your favorite web browser.  This also starts live-reload to watch the directory for changes and automatically reload the browser on change.

	grunt server

####Building for the web

The entire app can be compressed into lightweight, minified, and concatenated css, js, and html files using Grunt:

	grunt 

####Building for the desktop

flood can be used as a standalone application via node-webkit.  Just do this:

	grunt desktop

This will generate binaries for use on Mac and Windows in the dist_desktop folder.
